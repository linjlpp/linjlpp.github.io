Bio
======
**Jilan Lin** is a 2nd year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, UC Santa Barbara, starting from 2021. He got his B.E. from the Department of Computer Science, Tongji University. At UCSB, Zheng is working with Prof <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yufeiding/">Yufei Ding</a>. Zheng's research interests include high-performance computing and end-to-end optimization for deep learning. 

Below are some of his recent projects:
* System design for Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM).
* Neural network verification acceleration.
* Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Neural Networks.
